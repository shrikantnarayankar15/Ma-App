# Weather Cast App
# before deletion of source folder the app was installed on my phone. but that Can run only on my phone because i installed it by using USB (ADB apks cant run on other mobiles except the connceted one). i am sending you Images of my app. 
- Sir, this was most challenging App for me. I have used your given api of openweather. But while uploding the app to the github i eventually deleted my project folder by mistake. So i lost my whole source code. 

- I did that application in one day. i am feeling very awkward. All that work i was continuosly working for this app whole day. i got a call yesterday that deadline of your test is 30th june. So i thought i have this chance to prove myself that i can do things better. 

- In this app i have used aquery to decode the json which we get from the openweather api. 

- in app i used Google Map to locate the position.

- I have showed the Humidity, pressure, wind of current day. also the weekly weather forecast of application.

- final thing, i want to say that i did everything for this app. But my badlck that it was deleted by mistake.

- Whether you will select me or not its not the point. But i liked to work on my app. I can develop same app within 1 day but today is the deadline for your test. Thank you sir.

- but while testing the app which i installed on my mobile is i am uploding to u.

# by mistake i deleted the source folder of project.
